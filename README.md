# IndexMyLife
An organizational tool using "index" cards


After reading several books and visiting many internet sites, this is the online helper I have created for myself to keep me focused on what I need to do.  While the initial cards are geared towards house cleaning, the concept can be used for any type of tasks that need to repeated on a schedule.


Frameworks Used:
I anticipate using all the front and back-end tools I have recently learned in my bootcamp, including Node, Sequelize, AJAX, and others.  This readme will be updated regularly to be kept as accurate as possible.

Deployment:
Probably will never be deployed.  This is for me to help with my focus and to practice concepts just learned.

Feedback:
Feedback is welcome whether it is about the look or fucnctionality.
